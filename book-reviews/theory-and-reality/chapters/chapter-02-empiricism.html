      <h3>Chapter 2 — Empiricism</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>2.1 The Empiricist Tradition</li>
        <p>Empiricism regards experience as the primary if not only source of knowledge. This position has a long history, but its most notable development occurred during 
          the 18th and 19th centuries (Bacon, Locke, Berkeley and Hume). The "classical" forms of empiricism from this period present what may seem like a somewhat impoverished 
          view of the mind as a passive receiver of sensations, which is limited to learning sensory patterns and possibly generating responses. <br>
          This view, called <em>sensationalism</em>, readily lends itself to <em>skepticism</em>: the idea that 
          we can't know about the world beyond our perceptions. In particular, <em>external world skepticism</em> is about doubting whether our sensations can inform us of the 
          nature of the physical, the outer reality that is the source of our experiences. <em>Inductive skepticism</em> (associated with Hume) is doubt about whether we can infer any 
          necessary relations about our future sensations given the patterns of our past sensations. <br>
          For a sensationalist with external world skepticism, <em>phenomenalism</em> follows as a natural position: namely, that all we mean when we say "there is a tree", is that we make a claim about certain 
          sets of sensations that we can have and that we can't have in the context of some other set of sensations (e.g. of being in a particular person's backyard). Now, I don't think phenomenalism is bound
          to any <em>ontological</em> view (a position on whether an external physical reality really exists or not) but it seems to me that Godfrey-Smith conflates phenomenalism with <em>idealism</em> (the view that there only exist mind or mental stuff)
          with the sentence "All that exists is a collection  of observer-relative sensory phenomena" (p. 28). <br>
          Godfrey-Smith also mentions the historical competition of that time between empiricism and <em>rationalism</em>, an alternative view that holds reason (e.g. mathematical argumentation) to be an
          independent if not the primary source of knowledge (championed by e.g. Descartes, Leibniz). Kant synthesised these opposing views by arguing for the necessary role of experience for knowledge about the world,
          yet by opposing the view that the mind starts as a blank slate: rather, our experiences are structured by our minds according to prior cognitive concepts, e.g. in terms of space and time and causality, which mold our experiences 
          and make them intelligible. <br>
          The section finishes by noting that later (e.g. 20th century) uses of the term rationalism refer to forms of empiricism where "reasoning" has an important role to play, and by noting that 
          empiricist thinkers have generally been aligned in terms of their moderate and liberal (political), pro-science, and secular stances. 
           </p>
        <li>2.2 The Vienna Circle</li>
        <p>Neurath and Schlick founded the Vienna circle that developed logical positivism in post-WWI Vienna. The Vienna Circle was inspired by advances in science (e.g. Einstein's relativity) and dismayed at much of the obscure 
         philosophy of the post-Kant era. A chief target of their criticism was Hegel and his "absolute idealism" according to which reality is a rationally-intelligible unity, and beings like us develop via the
         process of coming to understand ourselves as parts of this greater unity (and indeed human history can be understood as the progress of this unfolding process). For the Vienna Circle, Hegel's work was too abstract and speculative, 
         and his language was vague and even pretentious. <br>
         The Circle's contemporaneous Heidegger was deemed even more obscure and unfathomable. A central theme of Heidegger's work was that the human experience is chiefly defined by one's coping 
         with the awareness of one's approaching death (e.g. by trying to live "authentically"). He was critical of trying to make sense of human life by fitting it into a bigger scientific picture.
         However, his style of writing was very dense and convoluted, making his views difficult to accurately assess. <br>
         The Vienna Circle advocated for clarity, logical argumentation, and precision, and against thinking steeped in mysticism and intuition that (in some cases) could more easily lend itself to nationalism and extremist politics. 
         Indeed, the Circle's members were politically liberal internationalists and generally supportive of social democracy, and so, with the rise of fascism in Europe, most of them fled, primarily to the US. 
         As we will see, the logical positivists' philosophical radicalism moderated in the US, with the work of this later more moderate period being often referred to as <em>logical empiricism</em>.
        </p>
        <li>2.3 Central Ideas of Logical Positivism</li>
        <p> 18th/19th century empiricism was based on views about the mind and perception, and their limitations. Logical positivism, in contrast, was based on theories about language and its capabilities and limitations.
        A central idea was <em>verificationism</em>, also known as the <em>verifiability principle</em>, or the <em>verifiability theory of meaning</em>: a sentence is meaningful if and only if it can be verified, or rather tested; that is, there are in principle observations that could affirm or negate the content of the sentence. 
        It follows that experience is the ultimate source of meaning, and if the claim/content of a sentence is untestable, then the sentence is meaningless. <br>
        Note, the logical positive acknowledged not all forms of meaning are covered by verificationism, e.g. sentences about <em>oughts</em> are not verifiable (e.g. one cannot observationally test the sentence "we should go to Peru"). 
        So, the meaning assessed by verifiability relates to claims about the world, and is sometimes refereed to as <em>factual meaning</em>. <br>
        The early logical positivists posited that every factually meaningful sentence could either itself be directly
        tested, or if not, then in principle be unambiguously translated into a corresponding set of sentences about observational claims, grounding its meaning. The associated ambitious program of translation was later abandoned, but the idea of verificationism remained. <br>
        All in all, for the logical positivists, traditional philosophy, ethics and theology were full of factual claims (about what the world is like) that failed the verifiability principle, and so these fields were deemed mostly meaningless. <br>
        However, what about mathematics and logically valid sentences that seemingly don't depend on observation? The logical positivists appealed to the distinction between <em>analytic</em> and <em>synthetic</em> sentences drawn up by Kant. 
        Analytic sentences are true or false by virtue of the meanings of the words in them, e.g. "all bachelors are unmarried" is true while "all numbers greater than 5 are odd" is false.
        Synthetic sentences additionally depend on the state of the world: "all bachelors are bald" claims something about the world, which of course is false. <br>
        The logical positivists held that Mathematics (when not applied to the world), and <em>a-priori</em> knowledge in general (things knowable independently of experience) are entirely analytic (unlike Kant), and so empty of any factual meaning. 
        Indeed, "there are infinitely many primes" may look significant, but if you break down a proof of this statement into its individual steps, the result will become "trivial and unsurprising", it is merely a record of our "decision to use symbols in a particular way" (p. 36). <br>
        Scientific language is full of synthetic statements. The Logical Positivists, in their analysis of scientific language made the distinction between <em>observational</em> and <em>theoretical</em> language. <br>
        Observational language is about terms or phrases referring to directly observable phenomena or measurements with little, if any, need for theory, e.g. "red" or "the surface is red". <br>
        Theoretical language refers to unobservable and theory-dependent entities or events that are posited in order to explain observations, e.g. "genes" or "electrons". <br>
        Schlick, in the vein of classical empiricism, equated observational language with descriptions of what can be directly sensed; statements about things beyond direct sensation were theoretical.
        Neurath believed that scientific claims should be publicly testable, and one's private sensations cannot fulfil that role. Therefore he insisted that descriptions of physical objects that 
        are measurable by publicly accessible devices and can be talked about using common and ordinary language are parts of observational language. Never mind that such descriptions may not seem "primitive" 
        in a way that descriptions of direct observations do. For, science is a social and common affair, and we can't boot it up from the "dry-dock" of our own private experiences, it is rather like a ship that is already sailing 
        (publicly testable concepts are e.g. its wooden planks), and we are "like sailors who have to rebuild their ship on the open sea" (p. 40) as science progresses and changes. <br>
        The rest of this section remarks on the importance the positivists placed on developing a theory for inductive logic; for, though fallible, inductive reasoning is central and indispensable to science. <br>
        Also, Godfrey-Smith remarks that in their quest to distil the logical structure of science, the logical positivists sidelined historical and psychological perspectives, which was to the ultimate detriment of their movement and understanding of science. </p>
        <li>2.4 Problems and Changes</li>
        Logical positivism faced many challenges. For example, formulating the verifiability principle in a way that covered scientific statements but excluded "senseless" traditional philosophy seemed tough. <br>
        Consider A = "metals expand when heated", which seems like a testable synthetic sentence, unlike "B = the Absolute Spirit is perfect". However, "A & B = metals expand when heated and the Absolute Spirit is perfect" also seems
        testable or at the very least falsifiable. Does it follow that such conjunctions are factually meaningful? <br>
        A deeper criticism of verficationism came from Quine in his "two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1951), where he argued that testing is always <em>holistic</em>. Holism refers to the notion that parts can only be understood in the context of the whole. <br>
        In particular, testing any sentence will rely on many background assumptions: e.g. about the reliability of the instruments used,
        the observers, and circumstances of the test, etc. So really, what you are testing is always a long conjunction "A & B & C & ...". Accordingly, a failure in a test may be attributable to a failure of any of these assumptions.
        It follows that verificationism might not be a practically viable principle. <br> 
        In their defence, the logical positivists had, prior to Quine's critique, frequently acknowledged the issue of background assumptions and holism in testing. In practice however, their principle of verifiability and earlier attitudes seemed to endorse considering
        sentences one at a time, and associating observable outcomes with a sentence in isolation. <br> 
        In any case, noting that testing is holistic does not settle the matter, indeed "we might often have good reasons to lay the blame for a failed prediction at one place rather than another. In practice, science often seems to have effective ways of working out where to lay the blame. 
        [However,] giving a philosophical theory of these decisions is a difficult task" (p. 42). <br>
        Quine took his view on the holism of testing and translated it into holism about meaning: since factual meaning depends on testability (according to the logical positivists), and since testing can only be done holistically, then meaning 
        can also only exist holistically; the sentences of a theory are meaningless in isolation. <br>
        What's more, given Quine's view that one's beliefs form a holistic "web of belief" that makes "contact with experience only as a whole", if a prediction fails, why can't we be flexible about what concepts need revision? In particular, what justifies a-priori experience-independent concepts? 
        Indeed, "Quine noted that strange results in  quantum physics had suggested to some that revisions in logic might be needed" (p. 44). Therefore, Quine rejected the analytic/synthetic distinction, as he denied that there can be analytic concepts that are immune to revision. <br>
        Again, in their defence, the logical positivists, especially by the time of Quine's critique, had become more flexible on this matter. Carnap deemed that analytic sentences can be revised, though only by virtue of an overall shift of an entire logical and linguistic framework; "within" a framework, 
        analytic concepts are entailed by the framework's postulates and inferential rules, and so are fixed. Hence, the logical positivists still held a more restrictive view than Quine, who did not prerequisite revisions of entire frameworks. </p>
        <li>2.5 Logical Empiricism and the Web of Belief</li>
        <p> While continuing their work on the logical analysis of science driven by ideas about language, the Post-WWII Logical Empiricists gave up the Vienna Circle's / logical positivists' revolutionary earlier attempt to destroy traditional philosophy and their political endorsement of social democracy. 
        What's more, "the analytic/synthetic distinction had not been rejected, but it was regarded as questionable" and the verifiability theory of meaning had been "replaced with a <em>holistic empiricist theory of meaning</em>. Theories were seen as structures that connect many hypotheses together. These structures are connected,
        as wholes, to the observable realm, but any part of a theory - a claim or hypothesis or concept - does not have some specific set  of observations associated with it. A theoretical term, such as "electron"  or "gene" derives its meaning from its place in the whole structure and  from the structure's connection 
        to the realm of observation" (p. 45). <br>
        Note, in contrast, Quine did not associate separate theories or areas of knowledge with separate structures/graphs; instead, he held the rather extreme position that one's entire set of all beliefs form one single "web of belief". <br>
        Moving on, the distinction between observational and theoretical language was retained, but the notion that observational language references private sensations was dropped in favour of talk about "public" physical objects and their measurements, 
        except for Carnap, who still "thought it might occasionally be useful to work with a language referring to sensations" (p. 45). <br>
        Furthermore, the Logical Empiricists still kept trying to explicate science as a logical system, and kept this work separate from historical and psychological analyses of science. <br>
        Whether common and intersubjective, or private and subjective, Logical Positivism had held that experience is the source of all factual knowledge, and what's more, they had held that all science can do, at the end of the day, is to track and explain patterns of experience, it does not reveal some real but hidden structure that lies beyond observation; in 
        "classical empiricist" fashion, there are no deeper meanings attached to theoretical concepts (e.g. electrons) beyond their utility as tools for making observational predictions. However, where did Logical <em>Empiricism</em> stand on this matter? <br>
        The logical empiricists desperately wanted to retain the classical empiricist attitude of denying facts beyond those about observations, but such a lofty attitude appeared to be far removed from actual scientific practice:
        "when scientists use terms such as "electron" or "gene," they act as if they are doing more than tracking complex patterns in the observable realm", it seems "scientific theories are aimed at describing unobservable real structures and processes" (p. 47). Indeed, "we can make sense of science only by treating much of it as an attempt to describe hidden structures that give rise to observable phenomena". <br>
        In any case, a dichotomy of observable and hidden parts of nature seem too crude; rather, there appear to be degrees of observability: "genes are hidden from us in some ways, but not as hidden as protons, which in turn are not as hidden as quarks" (p. 48), and as instruments change, so may these degrees. <br>
        Some Positivists such as Feigl tried to break away, noting that Positivism, roused by "the admittedly tremendous importance of the evidential basis for our knowledge claims" neglected if not denied "the very objects of those knowledge claims" (p. 49). In the end, early empiricist ideas about factual meaning that directly tied it to testing may have been too much to go against for the movement as a whole. </p>
        <li>2.6 Experience, Experiment, and Action</li>
        <p>Feynman said that "the principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: The  test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of  scientific 'truth.'". So experimentation, not just observation or experience, is important. Yet "astronomy was perhaps the first of all sciences to reach an advanced state" and progressed by virtue of careful observation 
        rather than experimentation. Darwin's theory of evolution also seems to have been grounded in "passive" observations rather than experimentation. <br>
        Or perhaps, we should think of experiments more broadly. "We often think of an experiment as setting up an arrangement to see what will happen (when I add this chemical to  this other chemical, and so on). But perhaps what is basic to experiment is just having an organized plan where you will do something - go through some procedure - and observe the results in a particular way. This might include pointing
        a telescope at the sky every night at a particular time". Alternatively, perhaps experimentation, which is indispensable, does require an ability to control and influence, and Feynman was saying that
        "science has to head toward experiment as much as possible, even if some progress is possible  without it" (p. 50).
         In any case, the role of action has chronically been neglected in empiricism, both in terms of how our actions may shape our sensations (and beliefs), and vice versa. </p>
        <li>My comments</li>
        <p>The resistance of the Logical Empiricists to the possible "existence" of theoretical concepts seems a bit strange to me. I understand and admire that the early Logical Positivists were essentially phenomenalists, but with the adoption of the intersubjective "physical objects" view of Neurath over the "private sensations" view of Schlick (with regards to observational language) it seems
          to me that the Rubicon had been crossed, as the possibility to reference entities beyond direct personal sensations had been admitted (even if only in a "pragmatic" sense). Yet, if you can pragmatically admit the idea of physical objects as inter-subjective conceptual entities that can be corroboratively observed and measured, then why can't you also admit unobservable (or partially/indirectly observable) theoretical 
          entities (that are posited by "theoretical language" to explain observable entities or processes)? I.e. if you have given up on strictly sticking to sensations, and admit the supposition of "public" physical objects, why only limit objecthood to what you can observe with the naked eye, and not to things that appear e.g. under an electron microscope or particle detector? As there seem to be no hard demarcations 
          between what is and isn't observable, admitting physical objects in any sense, in my view, entails admitting theoretical objects too. If the concept of e.g. "electrons" is too theory-laden for it to qualify under some notion of "out-there-ness", then I'd argue that "tables" suffer the same problem. <br>
          Perhaps I have misunderstood something here, or the book doesn't make it clear; maybe the Logical Positivists/Empiricists regarded physical objects as merely conceptually useful, and reserved the same scepticism for them as they did for theoretical objects/language. </p>
