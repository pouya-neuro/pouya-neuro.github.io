      <h3>Chapter 3 — Evidence and Induction</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>3.1 The Mother of All Problems</li>
        <p>Perhaps the most fundamental problem in the philosophy of science and Logical Empiricism in the last 100 years has been explaining how observations can serve as evidence
          for a theory. The logical empiricists termed this matter the <em>confirmation</em> of theories, and wanted a logical theory of confirmation/evidence that provided "an abstract relation between sentences",
          e.g. rules for how observational sentences may support theoretical sentences. Their approach failed but can help us understand later approaches. <br>
          Related to the confirmation of theories is the famous <em>problem of Induction</em>, most prominently considered by Hume (p. 55): 
          <blockquote>
          <p>What reason do we have for thinking that the future will resemble the past? There is no contradiction in supposing that the future could be totally unlike the past. 
          It is possible that the world could change radically at any point, rendering previous experience useless. How do we  know this will not happen? </p>
          </blockquote>
          Amusingly, arguments based on how it has worked out in the past to rely on "past pasts" to predict the "past futures" beg the question (assume the result they are trying to show). 
          Hume, as an <em>inductive sceptic</em>, concluded that induction has no rational basis and is just a habit.</p>
        
          <li>3.2 Induction, Deduction, Confirmation, and Explanatory Inference</li>
        <p>The Logical Empiricists' theory of confirmation/evidence was meant to explain both simple cases of induction e.g. "if we see a multitude ... of white swans, and no other colors, 
          why does that give us reason to believe that all swans are  white" (p. 55), as well as arguments that "seem to work very differently from a traditional induction", such as the "observational support for
          Copernicus's theory that the Earth goes around the sun, and ... Darwin's theory of evolution ... Darwin did not observe a set of individual cases of evolution and then generalize" (p. 56). <br>
          Additionally, the Logical Empiricists argued that many scientific inferences are not deductive, because they rely on observations that "are always of particular objects and occurrences" and yet 
          are intended as "generalizations ... having, at least potentially, an infinite range of application. No finite number of observations can conclusively establish [generalizations] of this kind, so inferences
          from observations in support of generalizations are always non-deductive" (p. 57). <br>
          Confusingly, the Logical Empiricists used "induction" to refer to all cases of good scientific arguments that are not deductive. However, Godfrey-Smith reserves <em>induction</em> for inferences where we "go from particular
          observations to generalisations" about all cases. Furthermore, a <em>projection</em> is an inference that goes from our observations to a prediction about the <em>next case</em> (e.g. all swans have been white, so the next swan will be white). 
          Clearly, inductions entail corresponding projections, and with some recursive tinkering, projections can also seemingly yield inductions, so maybe these two forms of arguments aren't that fundamentally different. <br>
          More interestingly, there is what Godfrey-Smith calls <em>explanatory inference</em>, perhaps better known as <em>abduction</em> or <em>inference to the best explanation</em>. The basic idea is, given a set of observations, we infer the 
          hypothesis that provides the <em>best</em> explanation. The criteria for "best" may vary, but it will generally apply to the hypothesis under which the observations are the most easily/well accounted for, 
          and which itself is independently the most reasonable or well supported; e.g. overnight rain is probably a better explanation for my wet lawn than there having been a midnight plane that dumped water. <br>
          Many philosophers, including some of the Logical Empiricists, have tried to show that there is fundamentally only one form of non-deductive reasoning, i.e. that abduction is reducible to induction, or vice versa. Indeed, one can seemingly reframe instances of induction 
          as abduction, e.g. "all swans are white" perhaps provides the best explanation for all observed swans having been white. 
          Conversely, the application of abduction in some new context can be motivated inductively or rather <em>projectively</em>:
          the procedure of abduction, or inference to the best explanation has, when considered over all previous applicable contexts, tended to yield the best inferences, 
          hence we are inductively/projectively justified in applying it in this new context. <br>
          While instances of abduction may seem more commonplace (in and outside of science), induction happens in practice too (e.g. Chargaff's rules), and efforts to frame one form of reasoning as instances of another seem to lose nuances and to be needlessly forced, 
          hence it may be sensible to acknowledge there being multiple forms of non-deductive reasoning. <br>
          The section returns to the problem of confirmation. Logical Empiricists such as Hempel tried to formulate induction in a logical way that made it seem as close as possible to deductive reasoning. Others, such as Carnap, developed 
          a sophisticated theory of confirmation based on probability theory "applied to artificial languages" (p. 60), an approach that fizzled out as its number of special assumptions kept increasing and its relevance to science kept diminishing. 
          Newer and more successful ways of using probability theory to understand the confirmation of theories, e.g. Bayesianism, are covered in chapter 12. <br>
          Finally, the section ends with a discussion of <em>Hypothetico-Deductivism</em> (HD): which may refer to the view that a "[hypothesis] in science [is] confirmed when [its] logical consequences turn out to be true", 
          i.e. when "a true statement about observables can be derived from it" (p. 61). This idea may appear straightforward, but taken naively, it seems to have many issues. We have already spoken about the holism of testing, i.e. the issue 
          "that a scientific hypothesis will only have consequences of a testable kind when it is combined with other assumptions". If we introduce a bit of deductive logic, more issues appear. Let <em>T</em> be any claim, and <em>S</em> be an observably true claim; 
          <em>T</em> deductively implies <em>T or S</em>, which in turn is confirmed by observation, and so it follows that <em>T</em> is also confirmed. Another problematic pattern would be the generalisation of the example from section 2.4: if <em>T</em> implies the observable statement
          <em>E</em>, then so does <em>T&S</em> (as it implies <em>T</em>), where <em>S</em> can be any statement. Now, verifying <em>E</em> confirms <em>T&S</em>, and by extension <em>S</em>.
          These absurd issues may make us wonder, "does the fault lie with [Hypothetico-Deductivism], with our summary of [it] using basic logic, or with basic logic itself? (p. 61). Faced with such questions, the Logical Empiricists were surprisingly more willing to question common 
          notions of evidence and confirmation than their view and application of logic. </p>
       
          <li>3.3 The Ravens Problem</li>
        <p>Switching birds, consider the hypothesis that all ravens are black, and suppose you have observed a number of black ravens. Naive combinatorial arguments for the confirmation of the former thesis based on the latter can fall short if the number of cases we aim to generalise to is infinite, or simply
          larger than our sample size of observations. Instead, let us provisionally follow Hempel, and accept as a "basic fact" that observations of black ravens support the hypothesis, i.e. "all <em>X</em> are <em>Y</em>" is supported by observations of <em>X</em> where <em>Y</em> is true. <br>
          Additionally, consider the prima facie benign idea that a confirmation of <em>Z</em> is a confirmation of any statement logically equivalent to <em>Z</em>. <br>
          Yet already, trouble appears from noting that a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, that i.e. "all ravens are black" is the same as "if it's not black, it's not a raven".
          Why? Because the contrapositive is confirmed by sampling an object that is not black and verifying that it is not a raven. That is, seeing e.g. a white object and noting it as a shoe supports the claim that all ravens are black. <br>
          Hempel first noted this strange result, and he accepted it as counter-intuitive yet valid. Unlike Godfrey-Smith, I tend to agree with Hempel, for in theory, considering the collection of all objects in the world (supposing such a collection is conceivable), then 
          there are two distinct ways of confirming the hypothesis: either we check all objects that are "ravens" and confirm that every single one of them is black, or we check all objects that are "non-black" and confirm that not a single one of them is a raven. 
          In the latter case, if there indeed exist any ravens, then they must be black, hence our claim is, at the very least, vacuously true. <br>
          Godfrey-Smith discusses the "holistic" criticism made against this whole set-up by I. J. Good, i.e. noting that "the relevance of an observation to a hypothesis is not a simple matter of the content of the two statements; it depends on other assumptions as well". These assumptions can be
          about what is a plausible hypothesis in the first place (p. 64):
          <blockquote> 
          <p> No biologist would seriously wonder whether seeing thousands of black ravens makes it likely that all ravens are black. Our knowledge of genetics and bird colouration leads us to expect some variation, such  as cases of albinism, 
          even when we have seen thousands of black ravens  and no other colors. </p>
          </blockquote>
          In practice, there will also be assumptions about what observations have any relevance towards testing some claim, e.g. browsing through your shoe-rack provides next to no chance of revealing any ravens (black or not), hence it does not help us test the hypothesis.
          Godfrey-Smith doubles down on this last point by arguing that only observations that have the potential to refute a hypothesis can support it. Intuitively, our confidence in there being no non-black ravens should only rise after making observations in contexts where we would expect to see non-black ravens (if they exist),
          e.g. if the collection is practically guaranteed to only contain black items or only non-raven items, then any observations will be irrelevant. Godfrey-Smith agrees that certain observations, regardless 
          of their context, will be relevant, e.g. an observation of a non-black raven, which would refute the hypothesis. But aside from such cases relating to <em>disconfirmation</em>, he argues that context matters, and points to his discussion in chapter 12 of the procedures 
          by which we generate data/observations. <br>
          From my point of view, Godfrey-Smith's points can be easily accommodated in Hempel's set-up. Coming back to our "collection of all objects": when we check our shoe-rack, we limit ourselves to checking a subset of objects that has no ravens in it, and so is irrelevant. In contrast, when we state that 
          we are sampling all non-black things, we are implicitly suggesting that we are sampling the world in such a way that there is a chance of sampling non-black ravens (if they exist), which wouldn't be the case if we e.g. are in fact staying put inside of a wardrobe. <br>
          Godfrey-Smith finishes the section by noting the famous "selection-task" from psychology that exposes some seemingly irrational biases that people hold towards confirmation. Among them, translated to raven-talk, is the belief that checking black objects is relevant towards the hypothesis. 
          However, such a collection will contain no non-black ravens (if there exist any), and so sampling it will not actually test the hypothesis.
          I speculate that we, as humans, tend to have this seemingly misguided bias for a number of reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>Firstly, we typically interpret claims such as "all ravens are black" as being non-vacuous, and that is something we then try to verify (that indeed there exist black ravens).</li> 
          <li>Secondly, we unconsciously hold the assumption that the data we are accessing is task "relevant"; i.e. given the context that there are some black objects to review, we expect that
          the "objects" will at least be birds, rather than shoes or a sample of items that has been randomly drawn from all black items in the universe. In turn, checking if any of the black object are ravens is relevant to the point above.</li> 
          <li>Thirdly, we tend to doubt a given claim in various aspects. From our experience, reality is messy, i.e. objects are rarely purely one colour, and borderline cases are common, and, in anticipation, we wish to have the broadest possible context to assess the claim. 
          That is, we will probably want to review all possible ravens, including the admittedly black ones. In other words, we anticipate that reality is messy, and that we will need to holistically review all available information to appraise the claim that all ravens are black. </li> 
        </ol> 
          Finally, another misguided bias people sometimes seem to have concerns disregarding non-black objects when testing the claim, when in fact these are the only objects that matter. This may stem from a heuristic to first and foremost focus on ravens, in order to get a better handle
          on the problem than getting caught up in all the likely irrelevant data out there on non-black non-raven items. 
        </p>
        
        <li>3.4 Goodman's "New Riddle of Induction"</li>
        <p>Goodman, via his critique of induction, famously argued that the confirmation of theories is not a purely <em>formal</em> matter. Consider the following:
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Argument 1</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Premise 1:</strong> All men are mortal</li>
            <li><strong>Premise 2:</strong> Socrates is a man</li>
            <li><strong>&rArr; Conclusion:</strong> Socrates is mortal</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
          This argument is valid by virtue of its <em>form</em>, and not because of the particular meaning of its terms. Indeed, we could substitute "men" with "F's", "mortal" with "G", and "Socrates" with "a", and it follows that "a is G". 
          In other words, "any argument with this form is deductively valid ... As long as the terms we put in do pick out definite properties or classes of objects, and as long as the terms retain the same meaning all the way 
          through the argument, the argument will be valid" (p. 68). <br>
          The Logical Empiricists wanted an account of confirmation and induction that is purely formal in this sense. Goodman used the following set-up to demonstrate that formal considerations alone will not be enough:
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Argument 2</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Premise:</strong> All the many emeralds observed, in diverse circumstances before the year 2026 have been green.</li>
            <li><strong>&rArr; Conclusion:</strong> All emeralds are green.</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        This seems like a good standard inductive argument. Goodman then defines the term "grue", which can mean something like: an object is "grue" if it was observed before 2026 and is green, or was not observed before 2026 and is blue. 
        Now consider the inductive argument:
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Argument 3</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Premise:</strong> All the many emeralds observed, in diverse circumstances beforee year 2026 have been grue.</li>
            <li><strong>&rArr; Conclusion:</strong> All emeralds are grue.</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        Arguments 2 and 3 clearly have the exact same form. Also, both have true premises. Now, if we believe that the conclusion of argument 2 is true by virtue of its form (and its true premise), it must follow that the conclusion of argument 3 is also true.
        However, the latter's conclusion seems absurd (all future Emeralds observed after the year 2026 should be blue) and is inconsistent with the former conclusion. <br>
        The "new riddle of Induction" lies in figuring out what is wrong with argument 3. The most common response to the riddle has been that "a good theory of induction should include a restriction of some kind on the terms that 
        occur in inductive arguments" (p. 70). But Goodman has argued that it's difficult to determine good restrictions. "Suppose we say that the problem with 'grue' is that its definition includes a reference to a specific time. 
        Goodman's reply is that whether or not a term is defined in this way depends on which language we take as our starting point. To see this, let us define a new term, 'bleen'":
        An object is bleen if and only if it was observed before the year 2026 and is blue, or if it was not observed before 2026 and is green. <br>
        Clearly, using "Blue" and "green" to define "grue" and "bleen" requires a reference to time. However, if we use a language where "grue" and "bleen" are "primitive" words instead, then the definitions of the "derived" words "blue" and "green" will require
        references to time:
          <blockquote>
          <p>An object is blue iff it was observed before the year 2026 and is bleen, or if it was not observed before 2026 and is grue.</p>
          </blockquote>
        This nice little symmetry motivates Goodman's point that a word's "being defined in terms of time" is a <em>language-relative</em> quality. So if we want to exclude such words from inductive arguments, then what is prohibited depends on what language we use. 
        Many philosophers have not liked the idea that confirmation should be so dependent on our vocabulary, and so:
        <blockquote>
        have tried to focus not on the words "green" and "grue" but on the properties that these words pick out, or the classes or kinds of objects that are grouped by these words. We might argue that greenness is a natural and 
        objective feature of the world, and grueness is not ... the green objects make up a  "natural kind," a kind unified by real similarity, while the grue objects are  an artificial or arbitrary collection. Then we might say: a good induction  
        has to use terms that we have reason to believe pick out natural kinds. Taking this approach plunges us into hard problems in other parts of philosophy. What is a property? What is a "natural kind"?
        </blockquote>
        Furthermore, Goodman's riddle relates to the "curve fitting" problem in data analysis. Given some data points, "fitting a strange function to the points seems to be like preferring a grue induction over a green induction (p. 72). In response, certain fits,
        such as straight lines may be preferred on the basis of their <em>simplicity</em> (note: Godfrey-Smith doesn't seem to love this common appeal to simplicity based on chapter 13) or some other constraints. Perhaps "green" induction is preferable to 
        "grue" on the basis of simplicity as well. The Goodman-esque response would be to say that "simplicity" will be a language-relative quality. <br>
        It seems that Goodman has added, on top of Hume's classic problem of induction, the issue that "whether or not some imagined future 'resembles the past' depends on which language we habitually use" (p. 72). Godfrey-Smith thinks that such issues  
        may be the result of an over-emphasis given to induction in theories of confirmation. He doesn't elaborate further, but this seems plausible to me; after all, if we'd put more emphasis on e.g. abduction, then from the get-go, we would have to face the question
        of what a "best" explanation is (do Emeralds being "grue" or being "green" give us a better account for our observations?). <br>
        The section ends with a wonderful bit on Bacon's advocacy for induction in a sense of the word that has gotten sidelined since Hume's work, yet is a sense that seems to be much better than the common contemporary one. Regarding induction, "for Bacon, what was important was a contrast between 
        different methods - different ways of approaching investigation ... His approach included looking for negative cases, and he also emphasized intervention in nature - experiment, not just observation. He said a scientist should 'twist the lion's tail', not merely 
        take in what's going on..., and what the idea of induction carried with it at that time was partly an ideal of flexibility in intellectual life" (p. 73). This is a far cry from the simple tallying of cases and an impoverished view of induction as 
        the "relationship between individual cases and generalizations" (p. 74) that later philosophers have reduced it to in their attempts to analyse confirmation systematically and exactly.</p> 
        
        <li>3.5 Optional Section: A Little More about Hypothetico-Deductivism</li>
        <p>Recall, a simple statement of the HD-view is that "hypotheses in science are confirmed when their observational consequences turn out to be true" (p. 74). Since this is about confirmation, we mentioned that the issue of holism in testing becomes relevant. But the question then is, if a theory alongside some background assumptions
          makes a correct prediction, what exactly is confirmed? Suppose "Newton's laws of motion and gravity, together with other assumptions [e.g. about utilised equipments, experimenters, data, etc.] are used to successfully predict an observation about ... the return of a comet". We might
          believe that <em>every</em> part of the network of theories/assumptions invoked to make the prediction deserves some credit. But then, we will be susceptible to the "<em>T&S</em>" scenario outlined in section 3.2 (p. 75):
        <blockquote>
          We can add some apparently irrelevant claims to Newton's laws and still get the same prediction. Newton's  laws plus Freud's psychology, along with the background assumptions we needed before, will give us the same successful prediction about the sky. 
          Do we give some credit to Freud as well?
        </blockquote>
        To deal with this, we may try to only give credit to the <em>relevant</em> parts of the theory and set of assumptions, but then we will have to deal with a slippery slope:
        <blockquote>
          Newton's laws cover all physical bodies, not just comets and stars and planets. Should we give credit only to some parts of Newton's theory, when it does well with the comet?
        </blockquote>
        Newton's theory may treat all massive objects the same, but a postulate of "equal treatment" may not have been required for the comet prediction. The strictly relevant parts of the theory could end up looking very small. Clearly, the HD-view has its share of challenges. </p>
        <li>My comments</li>
        <p>As stated, I think abduction provides a better "starting point" than induction does for how non-deductive scientific explanation and reasoning work. With abduction, we have to proactively deal with the question of which hypotheses are more or less reasonable, and so face problems such as Goodman's riddle head-on.
          Even the raven paradox can be framed as an issue of having underspecified assumptions about our data collection process (how exactly are we sampling "non-black" items?). Before we can infer the best explanation (i.e. do abduction), we will probably have to consider the data collection process, e.g. question 
          whether we have any evidential basis for confirming (increasing our belief in) the proposition that "all ravens are black" after looking through a rack of colourful shoes. Still, abduction seems too passive and unsatisfying in other respects: it seems that in science we are not just passively accumulating data 
          and periodically coming up with "best explanations". We often make conjectures and design experiments, i.e. engineer the data collection process, to test our claims. The HD-view seems to capture this conjecture-driven aspect of scientific enquiry, and so it should also be a part of our picture of scientific confirmation.
          As we have noted, HD faces its own seemingly foundational and basic issues, and I do not want to make any insinuation that the challenges of "credit assignment" and holism in testing are easy. I.e. I think that the question of what parts of a theory (and assumptions) are confirmed/supported by certain observations is 
          highly non-trivial and probably has to be dealt with in a case by case basis (e.g. depending on the diversity of data, what prior knowledge we have, and what exact assumptions we are willing to make).
