      <h3>Chapter 4 — Popper: Conjecture and Refutation</h3>
      <ul class="list">

        <li>4.1 Popper's Unique Place in the Philosophy of Science</li>
        <p>Popper is a rare case of a philosopher whose work is held in high regard by many working scientists. He identified concepts others had missed, and his views are cited within scientific debates. 
          Yet despite his continuing appeal, many philosophers, including Godfrey-Smith, think that there are inescapable problems with his views.</p>
        
          <li>4.2 Popper's Theory of Science</li>
        <p>Popper was often difficult to deal with. Starting his career in pre-WWII Vienna alongside the Logical Positivists who were interested in a general theory of language and meaning, Popper kept his focus on science. 
          The <em>demarcation problem</em> is what Popper termed the primary task of distinguishing science from non-science. "For Popper, an inspiring example of genuine science was the work of Einstein. Examples of 
          pseudo-science were Freudian psychology and Marxist views about society and history." Popper's proposed solution was <em>falsificationism</em>, the claim that "a hypothesis is  scientific if and only if it has the 
          potential to be refuted by some possible observation" (p.79).
          Popper took this idea much further though, insisting that (p. 80):
          <blockquote> 
          all empirical work in science has the form of attempting to refute theories by means of observation. Crucially, for Popper it is never possible to 
          confirm or establish a theory by showing its agreement with observations. Confirmation is a myth ... the truth of a scientific theory can never be supported  by observational evidence, not even a little bit, 
          and not even if the theory  makes a huge number of predictions that all come out as expected.
          </blockquote>
          Popper hence rejected the Logical Positivists' search for a theory of confirmation/induction. What's more, like Hume, he was an inductive sceptic. To be clear, most philosophers agree with <em>fallibilism</em>, 
          the idea "that we can never be completely certain about factual issues", and many endorse falsificationism, but consider Popper's scepticism about confirmation as being too extreme, and his arguments for such 
          views as being unconvincing and misleading. Indeed, many scientists who admire Popper may not that know about his more radical positions. <br>
          From the way Godfrey-Smith describes it, Popper seemed to base his rejection of confirmation on his scepticism about induction: almost all significant scientific hypotheses seem to be generalisations
          applicable to future / potentially infinitely many cases, while only being justified on the basis of finitely many past cases/observations. However, if like Hume, one doubts induction, then such generalisations
          are not justifiable. <br>
          Unlike most, Popper felt that such scepticism does not pose an issue for science, and that we should keep doing research but just "retain a tentative attitude toward our theories, no matter how successful 
          they have been in the past". <br>
          Indeed it may seem a bit strange, but "despite insisting that we can never support or confirm scientific theories, Popper believed that science is a search for true descriptions of the world" (p. 82). It's just that in practice,
          because it is impossible to check whether a proposed law/hypothesis holds over the infinitely many cases where it should apply, we can never conclude that the hypothesis is true in the sense it is claimed (as a law-like generalisation). 
          In my opinion, it can already be argued from the information presented here that Popper's particular alleged stance against confirmation is unreasonable, and I will elaborate on this point in my comments on this chapter. </p>
        
          <li>4.3 Popper on Scientific Change</li>
        <p>Beyond the demarcation problem, Popper applied falsificationism to propose a theory of scientific change: science changes via a repetitive 2-step cycle. Step 1 is <em>conjecture</em>, where the scientist makes a hypothesis,
        ideally a "bold one ... that takes a lot  of risks by making novel predictions". Stage 2 is <em>attempted refutation</em> where the hypothesis is tested until it is falsified. Then we cycle back to stage 1, etc. <br>
        It is common and acceptable, though by no means essential, if new conjectures appear to be refinements/modifications of previously falsified conjectures, as long as the newer version is not simply the old conjecture + an ad-hoc "patching 
        over" of the old conjecture's problem areas. 
        <blockquote>
        <p>Instead a scientist should constantly strive to  increase the breadth of application of a theory, and increase the precision of its predictions. That means constantly trying to increase the  "boldness" of conjectures.</p>
        </blockquote>
        As opposed to just adding in special cases for where the old conjecture's predictions failed. Popper intended this view to serve as a prescriptive model that is to be emulated, inspired by the best in science (e.g. Einstein's work in response to 
        the empirical shortcomings of classical mechanics). <br>
        Recall that Popper urged us to hold a tentative attitude towards our own theories. Accordingly, both the labour of conjecturing and testing should be endorsed, if not carried out, by the same investigators, whether they are a single individual 
        or a community. Popper did not approve of communities that divide up this labour, or even worse, that are split up into rival camps, which try to falsify the others camps' conjectures as opposed to their own. By not living up to Popper's ethos,
        such camps, avoidant of self-criticism, might not accept refutations of their own theories. On the other hand, despite Popper's ideals, it seems potentially conceivable that science could work even if there are narrow-minded specialists (e.g. conjecturers and refuters), 
        as long as the resultant community as a whole ends up being open-minded enough towards refutations and new conjectures. <br>
        Moving on, Godfrey-Smith notes that Popper has positively influenced some working scientists by helping them to be more comfortable with being wrong, learning from their mistakes, and changing their views. <br>
        Finally, in this section, Godfrey-Smith notes an apparent resemblance (that Popper himself already noted and explored) between Popper's 2-step process and Darwin's evolutionary theory: Conjecture resembles random variation and mutation as new forms of life emerge, 
        and refutation resembles natural selection, as life-forms are "tested" for survival and reproduction in their environments.</p>
      
        <li>4.4 Objections to Popper on Falsification</li> 
        <p>Instead of envisioning an explicit division of theories into scientific and non-scientific, practically we may view the demarcation problem and Popper's response to it as being about characterising scientific vs. unscientific ways of investigating the world and handling ideas. <br>
          In that light, it seems more clear that Popper's ideas, as laid out so far, are a bit simplistic. For one, falsification/refutation must grapple with the holism of testing. Suppose we conjecture that iron expands when heated, and want to test this with a piece of metal. For the observation to count,
          we will need to make a lot of background assumptions (e.g. that the metal is iron, the heating works, we measure lengths correctly, etc.), any of which can fail or be questioned, especially if our prediction (of expansion) does not obtain. <br>
          In more extreme cases, "we might even claim that [an] apparent observation was completely misunderstood or wrongly described by the observers. Indeed, this is not so uncommon in our attempts to work out what to make of reports of miracles and UFO abductions" (p. 87). 
          Clearly, "a theory can't 'take risks,' in the way Popper likes, all on its own". Indeed (p. 88): 
          <blockquote>
            <p>Popper was aware of this problem, and he struggled with it. He regarded the extra assumptions needed to connect theories with testing situations as scientific claims that might well be false-these are conjectures too. We can try to test these conjectures separately.
              But Popper conceded that logic itself can never force a scientist to give up a particular theory in the face of surprising observations. Logically, it is always possible to blame other assumptions involved in the test. Popper thought that a good scientist would
              not try to do this; a good scientist would want to expose the theory itself to tests and not try to deflect the blame. </p>
          </blockquote>
          It seems that:
          <blockquote>
          <p>what Popper has done is move from describing a characteristic of scientific theories to describing a characteristic of scientific behavior. In some ways this is a retraction of his  initial aim, which was to describe something 
          about scientific theories themselves that makes them special. That is a problem. Then again, this shift to describing scientific modes of thought and behavior, rather than theories, might be a step forward.</p>
          </blockquote>
          This retreat goes hand-in-hand with the acknowledgement that "we have to regard the acceptance of an observation report as a 'decision,' one that is freely  made" (p. 88). This is a far cry from a framework where an observation that goes against a theory's prediction,
          falsifies the theory with the power of logical necessity. Additionally, every background assumption itself may be questioned and tested and "decided upon". <br> 
          Yet, if "any system of hypotheses can be held onto despite apparent falsification if people are willing to make certain decisions [about observational reports] ... does Popper's view end up giving us any way to differentiate between science 
          and pseudo-science?" Popper thought it still did, arguing that "a scientific theory is falsifiable via a certain <em>kind</em> of decision - a decision about an observation report, which together with background assumptions can clash with a theory. A pseudo-scientific theory, Popper says, does 
          not have this feature" (p. 89). <br>
          Moving on, another problem for Popper's view arises with theories that "ascribe very low probabilities to specific observations, but do not rule them out altogether". Strictly speaking, such theories that do not fully rule out any potential observations, are unfalsifiable and so unscientific. 
          But, in order to reconcile such theories with his views, Popper admitted that "it is up to scientists to work out, for their own fields, what sort of probability is so low that events of that kind are treated as prohibited", in turn yielding criteria for falsification as  
          "scientists [can] reject theories when observations occur that the theory says are highly improbable", i.e. <em>in practice</em> prohibited. <br>
           Though pragmatic, this move inflicts yet more damage to Popper's original picture of science, where "observations, once accepted, [had] the power to decisively refute theoretical hypotheses ... [as] a matter of deductive logic" (p. 90). 
           Now, Popper was admitting that falsification can be backed up by improbability, as opposed to deduction. Indeed, just as in the case of background assumptions and observation reports, we are to give up on logical necessity and adopt fallible decision making (e.g. on when something is improbable enough to count as refutation).</p>

        <li>4.5 Objections to Popper on Confirmation</li>
        <p>Setting aside the problems highlighted in 4.4 with applying falsification in practice, Popper's rejection of confirmation, in and of itself, leaves us with the major conceptual limitation of not being able to meaningfully favour "tried and tested" hypotheses over new untested speculations. <br>
        To be clear, Popper gives us grounds to favour hypotheses that have survived testing over those that have been falsified, but what do we make of a potentially wild new theory (that presumably seemingly agrees with observations made up to now, though this point is not stated in the book) that has not yet been tested? 
        Popper insisted that there are no valid grounds for preferring the "tried and tested" theory over the latter; sure, the former might be "corroborated" (p. 93) by all the past testing, but the theory is still only tentative, hence we are left with a "tie". This state of affairs appears especially disconcerting if we consider it 
        in the context of critical real world settings such as bridge building. <br>
        Moving on, Godfrey-Smith notes that, its issues notwithstanding, Popper gave us a valuable account of how science works. Indeed, Popper's 2-stage theory of change in science can be nicely merged with Hypothetico-Deductivism by admitting some notion of confirmation or support for theories that survive repeated testing. 
        The resulting picture of doing science is often called the hypothetico-deductivist <em>method</em>. <br>
        As a minor note, an extra first stage "in which observations are [first] collected and a conjecture is generated from these observations" is often included in the method, though Popper would disapprove of this, as he held that 
        "fact-gathering always takes place in a way guided by conjectures" (p. 94), and so cannot precede conjecturing. <br> 
        Another idea Popper would disagree with is <em>strong inference</em>, which holds that confirmation is consistent with a Popperian view of enquiry, because "we can write down all the possible theories that 
        might be true in some area, and test them one by one. We find the true theory by eliminating the alternatives." Popper held that in any real problem area, the number of possible hypotheses will be infinite, ruling out such an exhaustive eliminative search. <br>
        In the section's conclusion, Godfrey-Smith lauds what he considers Popper's "most important and enduring contribution to  philosophy of science ... his use of the idea of <em>riskiness</em> to describe the kind of contact that scientific theories have with observation." (p. 95) 
        He elaborates:
        <blockquote>
          <p>Science tries to formulate and handle ideas in  such a way that they are exposed to falsification and modification via observation. Popper's formulation is valuable because it captures the idea  that theories can appear to have lots of contact with observation when in fact they only have a kind of "pseudo-contact" with observation, 
          because  they avoid all risks. This idea is a real advance.</p>
        </blockquote></p>

        <li>4.6 Further Comments on the Demarcation Problem</li>
        <p>Godfrey-Smith encourages us to view Popper's valuable criterion of risk-taking not as a means of distinguishing scientific theories from non-scientific ones, but rather as a means of distinguishing scientific ways of handling ideas from non-scientific ways (p. 96):
          <blockquote>
            <p>The scientific way of handling an idea is to try to connect it with other ideas, to embed it in a larger conceptual structure, in a way that exposes  it to observation. This "exposure" is not a matter of simple falsification;  
              there are many ways in which exposure to observation can be used to  modify and assess an idea. But if a hypothesis is handled in a way that keeps it apart from all the risks associated with observation, that is an  unscientific
               handling of the idea.  So it is a mistake to try to work out whether theories such as Marxism  or Freudianism are themselves "scientific" or not, as Popper did. A big  idea like Marxism or Freudianism will have scientific and 
               unscientific  versions, because the main principles of the theory can be handled scientifically or unscientifically. Scientific versions of Marxism and Freudianism are produced when the main principles are connected with other 
               ideas in a way that exposes these principles to testing. To scientifically  handle the basic principles of Marxism is to try to work out what difference it would make to things we can observe if Marxist principles  were true. 
               To do this it is not necessary that we write down some single  observation that, if we encounter it, will lead us to definitively reject the  main principles of the theory. It will remain possible that a background  assumption 
               is at fault, and there is no simple recipe for adjudicating  such decisions.</p>
          </blockquote> 
        Godfrey-Smith further considers these examples of broadly disconfirmed theories that have been cast aside to varying degrees: Marxism has been mostly given up on (in academia) whereas Freudianism still remains popular in a few circles outside of psychology. Indeed, while Godfrey-Smith admits
        that Freud's idea of unconscious mental processes lives on in mainstream psychology, he holds that only having a few of its key concepts persist cannot warrant deeming the broader theory of Freudianism as tenable, let alone validated. <br>
        Moving on, Godfrey-Smith considers evolution as (p. 97):
        <blockquote>
          <p>another big idea that can be handled either scientifically or unscientifically. People (including Popper) have wondered from time to time whether evolutionary theory, or some specific version of it such  as Darwinism, is testable. What observations would lead scientists to
            give up current versions of evolutionary theory? A one-line reply that biologists sometimes give to this question is "a Precambrian rabbit."</p>
        </blockquote>
        While that is a slick line, Godfrey-Smith, in a way that reminds me of the issues regarding credit assignment for the HD-view (section 3.5), elaborates that the process of determining what actually would then be falsified would not be so simple (p. 98):
        <blockquote>
          <p>[a Precambrian rabbit fossil] would not be an instant falsification of all of evolutionary theory, because evolutionary theory is now a diverse package of ideas, including abstract theoretical models as well as claims about the actual history of life on Earth. 
            The theoretical models are intended to describe what various evolutionary mechanisms can do in principle. Claims of that kind are usually tested with mathematical analysis and computer simulation. Evolution on a small scale can also be observed directly in the lab,
             especially in bacteria, viruses, yeast, and some animals like fruit flies. The Precambrian rabbit would not affect those results. But a Precambrian rabbit fossil would show that ... there are some serious errors ... [in the theory]
             about the overall history of life, about the kinds of processes through which a rabbit-like organism could evolve, and probably about the "family tree" of species on Earth. The challenge would be to work out where the errors lie, and would require separating out
              and independently reassessing each of the ideas that make up the package. This reassessment could, in principle, result in the discarding of basic evolutionary beliefs, like the idea that humans evolved from non-human animals.</p>
        </blockquote>
        The section ends with Godfrey-Smith noting that evolutionary theory has in fact survived a great empirical test that took place in recent times: namely, the comparison of phylogeny against genetic data that became obtainable due to advances in molecular biology (p. 99):
        <blockquote>
          <p>Suppose the DNA differences between humans and  chimps suggested that the human lineage split off from the lineage that  led to chimps many hundreds of millions of years ago and that humans  are instead closely genetically related to squid. 
            This would have been an enormous shock for evolutionary theory, one of almost the same magnitude as the Precambrian rabbit.</p>
        </blockquote>
        The section ends with Godfrey-Smith noting that such shocking surprises did not obtain. In any case, it seems that the scientific handling of ideas is no simple task.
        </p>
        <li>My comments</li>
        <p>Returning to section 4.2, though Godfrey-Smith writes about it ambiguously, Popper's denial of confirmation does not seem to stem from a radical scepticism about induction, but rather from a scepticism about generalisation. Simply put, I think Popper was not arguing that
        "scientific theories are tentative because gravity could turn off tomorrow as there is no logical necessity for it to continue working tomorrow", but rather "there is no logical necessity for a theory of gravity developed here on Earth that predicts locally observable phenomena to generalise to 
        other regions or conditions in the universe which are different" and "there are far more, perhaps even infinitely many diverse conditions under which we would have to test a theory to verify that it generalises, and since we can never achieve such a thing, no theory will ever be confirmed". <br>
        In response, I think Popper was needlessly holding confirmation to a far too extreme of a standard: suppose some theory $T_1$ fits (i.e. accurately predicts) some observations $D_1$ but fails on some observations $D_2$ that are generated under different conditions. 
        Suppose we then come up with a new theory $T_2$ that predicts the observations in $D_1$ and $D_2$. Popper would presumably argue that $D_1$ and $D_2$ will not be representative of all possible conditions/scenarios that $T_2$ makes predictions about, 
        as it presumably is a theory that makes general law-like claims that apply to the whole universe under all possible circumstances. <br> 
        But even under such an extreme characterisation of the theory, its conceivable that $D_1$ covers, say, 90% of the scenarios we typically encounter, 
        and $D_1$ together with $D_2$ jointly cover 99.9% of all scenarios/conditions we encounter; if so, is it really sensible to say that $T_2$ is no more accurate or supported that $T_1$? Even if we insist that there could still be infinitely many more conditions to test, pragmatically, for our local conditions, the theory 
        $T_2$ at the very least seems more accurate/supported than $T_1$. Note, something similar can be said about prediction error, e.g. if $T_2$ makes prediction errors that are generally one order of units smaller than those of $T_1$, is it fair to say that just because $T_2$ still gives <em>some</em> residual error, it follows
        that it is "just as" falsified of a theory as $T_1$ is? Despite what Popper's all-or-nothing conception of confirmation suggests, in a stable and intelligible universe, the (at the very least) local convergence of theories to "reality", and hence the possibility of progressive confirmation/correctness seems plausible. <br>
        Moving on, Popper's simultaneous dismissal of confirmation and admission of the role of human "decision making" with regards to the reception of observational reports and their background assumptions seem to (depending on how we interpret Popper's views) entail a sort of general epistemic scepticism, where falsification too is uncertain. 
        That is, falsification ends up being no less speculative and unfeasible than confirmation. The simple idea that Popper himself seemed to accept is that the validity of any given background assumption $X$ will ultimately be a matter that researchers can contest and decide upon. 
        As such, the supposition that $X$ holds during our attempt to test/falsify some $Y$ may be interpreted as a conjecture, and so its validity ought to remain tentative, but since $X$ is required to make the test for $Y$ valid, it follows that the results of the test, i.e. any potential falsification of $Y$ will also be tentative. <br>
        Note, the argument I just laid out is quite general and can be applied to any observational test (resting on contingent background assumptions), so it follows that any falsification is tentative. Also, Godfrey-Smith essentially leads us to the same result in 4.4 (p. 89) arguing that we could:
        <blockquote>
          <p> just "decide" to hang onto a theory and reject the observation reports that conflict with it ... Popper has not given us a good reason  not to do [this].</p>
        </blockquote>
        As such, all we have done is laid out an alternative line of argumentation to arrive to the same "breakdown" of (strong interpretations of) Popper's position, i.e. arriving at the same absurd state of affairs where any hypothesis is plausible as nothing can be refuted. <br>
        My main takeaway here is that Popper's total rejection of confirmation seems too extreme and unwarranted given other premises that he seems to accept, in particular regarding the universe being intelligible and stable (in the sense that its behaviour is consistent and can be discerned). 
        For granted such premises, the notions of falsification and confirmation seem to be conceptually too close to one another for one to be possible while the other is not.
