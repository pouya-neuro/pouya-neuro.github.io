      <h3>Chapter 1 — Introduction</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>1.1 Setting Out</li>
        <p>To philosophise about science is to ask what science is, how is works, what is achieves, and how it may differ from other ways of investigating the world.
           Godfrey-Smith states he will cover topics in the philosophy of science in chronological order starting from the early 20th century.
           While some relevant questions, such as the nature of reality, may seem abstract and far-removed, Godfrey-Smith notes that there has been a lot of contention
           that has had real-world significance (e.g. affecting politics and scientific practice itself) on the trustworthiness of scientific work and knowledge, which 
           reached the level of "science wars" in the late 20th century, where some argued against science's dominant contemporary authority and status in western society.</p>
        <li>1.2 The Scope of the Investigation</li>
        <p>Before studying science, we'll need to define it, and we can try to define it <em>by example</em>: surely physics and biology count as sciences? Already, there is controversy:
          perhaps much of modern theoretical physics can be better described as fancy mathematical exercises, and biology is becoming less scientific as a result  
          of its extensive contacts with big pharma and big tech. The case of the social sciences (e.g. psychology and economics) appears to be yet more contentious. Often, the "scientific label" may be sought
          by a field as it suggests that their work is rigorous and verified; in any case, "science" appears to be a loaded term. <br>
          Godfrey-Smith also notes that the term itself historically referred to forms of provable/deductive knowledge, and its more observational and experimental slant came 
          relatively recently (e.g. the term "scientist" with its current sense was coined in the 19th century). <br>
          Finally, when people talk of science, their scope can vary: on the one end, any rigorous and observation-driven effort to learn about a phenomenon may be viewed as
          science. On the other end, science should only refer to the work that begun in Europe in the context of the "Scientific Revolution" of the 17th century, and to fields of 
          inquiry that have carried on that work since. This latter view often insinuates that there must be something that sets science apart from general human inquiry. Accordingly, understanding
          science can mean anything from understanding how humans gain knowledge about the world in general and how this essentially subsumes the work done in the Scientific Revolution 
          and the fields of research that have followed from it, to (in the case of the latter view) understanding how these fields of inquiry are indeed different from general human inquiry. </p>
        <li>1.3 What Kind of Theory?</li>
        <p>Whether we look at science narrowly or broadly, we will have to deal with questions about evidence and support. These questions have practical (when is a claim evidenced and trustworthy) if not foundational importance 
           (how does observation advance science)? Yet, it seems that many scientific ideas cannot be ever be proven, e.g. can we unequivocally prove that mitochondria descend from bacteria?
           On the other hand, substantiated and predictive scientific theories seem to be much more than mere speculations. Therefore, the role of evidence and support is a recurring topic in this book. <br>
           Some philosophers have tried to formalise science into a logical system that follows rules for producing knowledge; indeed there also have been historical efforts to define 
           a scientific "method", but actual scientific practice and progress seem to not be well described by such rigid and formal prescriptive frameworks. <br>
           Related to the notions of evidence and knowledge is "objectivity", a tricky term referring to the quality of being independent of the mind's conception of the world. 
           It seems unclear whether any man-made theory can ever be shown to be objective in such a sense. <br>
           Other fields such as sociology and history, which have analysed science, have often tried to side-step such questions about evidence and truth, but any satisfying account of 
           science seems to require dealing with them, though these neighbouring fields can greatly enrich the philosophical perspective on science. </p>
        <li>1.4 Three Answers, or Pieces of an Answer</li>
        <p>Godfrey-Smith discusses three key features of science: empiricism, the usage of mathematics, and its social structure. These features are sometimes split up among rival accounts of 
          why science works, but Godfrey-Smith argues it is best to view them as complementary, and to take on the challenge of integrating them into one cohesive explanation of science. <br>
         Then there is also the question of whether these features are <em>distinguishing</em>. Indeed, while empiricists broadly support science, they often question the notion that science is somehow fundamentally distinct from general human inquiry:
        <blockquote>
        <p>Scientific thinking and investigation have the same pattern as everyday thinking and investigation. In each case, the only source of knowledge about the world is experience.
         But science is especially successful because it is organized, systematic, and particularly responsive to experience.</p>
        </blockquote>
        Empiricism may seem like an obvious position, but its advocates often point to historical examples, such as Ignaz Semmelweiss and hand washing, or John Snow and cholera, of when groundbreaking observational findings failed to, or 
        only with great difficulty, managed to overrule established beliefs. However, a focus on empiricism can sometimes understate the role of creativity and imagination in science.
        Another aspect emphasised is science's quantitativeness: 
        <blockquote>
        <p>What makes science different from other kinds of investigation, and especially successful, is its attempt to understand the natural world using mathematical concepts and tools.</p>
        </blockquote>
        This view can complement empiricism, but also conflict with it, as mathematical deduction appears to present a route to knowledge that can work independently of observation. Galileo seems to have 
        even advocated for the precedence of mathematical reasoning over observation, <q>praising Copernicus's heliocentric model for making ‘reason conquer sense [experience]’</q>. But even then, Godfrey-Smith
        deems it more reasonable to consider the use of mathematics as something that distinguishes science from some other forms of observation-driven inquiry, as opposed to denying the key role of observation/empiricism. <br>
        Finally, in large parts thanks to the work of historians and sociologists, there is the perspective that:
        <blockquote>
        <p>What makes science different from other kinds of investigation, and especially successful, is its unique social structure.</p>
        </blockquote>
        Proponets such as Shapin have argued that "experience is everywhere" and it is a "fantasy that each person can test hypotheses individually" (p. 16). A social structure that supports trust, cooperation,
         competition, and credit assignment is crucial for the functioning of science. Indeed, institutions that have served these purposes have been around for longer than one might expect: the 
         Royal society of London dates back to 1660! However, Godfrey-Smith again suggests that this view is not incompatible with the other views discussed. Lastly, he notes that the book itself will focus
         on the themes of empiricism and social structure, while not denying the role of mathematics.</p> 
        <li>1.5 A Sketch of the Scientific Revolution and What Came Afterward</li>
        <p>As the title suggests, we are introduced to some of the landmark figures and events of the Scientific Revolution (spanning 1550 - 1700), as well as the sciences that followed it. We are told that the Revolution occurred in the context
        of a freeing-up of intellectual culture amid great social changes in Europe preceding the Revolution, and that the Revolution overruled the till-then dominant view of nature, known as scholasticism, which combined 
        the doctrines of Christianity with the views of Aristotle, and some other ancient figures such as the physician Galen and the astronomer Ptolemy. Godfrey-Smith briefly briefly reviews the geocentric scholastic world view and then
        discusses the contrasting heliocentricism of Copernicus. He notes that some advocates of Copernicus, such as Osiander urged others to merely regard the heliocentric model as a predictive tool, and not to take its postulates literally. 
        Such a view of science, as only being a set of practical theories for prediction, rather than attempts to describe the true nature of reality is called <em>instrumentalism</em>. <br>
        However, Galileo famously argued for the literal truth of heliocentricism, and devised mathematical principles to explain how the view is reconcilable with its apparent problems, e.g. the fact that an object dropped from a tower seems to fall in 
        a straight line to its base even though the Earth will have moved considerably during the drop. Later, Kepler greatly simplified and improved the heliocentric model by exchanging circular orbits for ellipses. <br>
        During the early period of the Scientific Revolution, the field of physiology also saw a turn to empiricism under Vesalius and later significant progress, e.g. Harvey established in 1628 the circulation of blood and the pumping function of the heart. <br>
        The mid 17th century saw the development of the <em>mechanism</em> view of nature: the world is made up of tiny "corpuscles" that causally interact only via direct physical contact; the world operates like a mechanical clock. 
        Boyle integrated the mechanism view into an empirical research program that gave a central role to observation, and the mid 17th century also saw the rise of research societies that challenged traditional universities. <br>
        Newton, through his physics, is regarded to have "completed" the Revolution, explaining via a single theory both the celestial motions and the kinematics of everyday objects. Note, Newton's gravitation acting instantaneously at a distance does not  
        sit well with the mechanism view, hence why Newton's physics is sometimes regarded as being post-mechanical. <br>
        Following the Revolution, the 18th and 19th centuries saw the dramatic development of chemistry (Lavoisier, Dalton, Mendeleev, etc.) and biology (Linnaeus, Darwin, Mendel, etc.). This progress made it possible that by the 20th century, <em>vitalism</em>, the view
        that living beings must be endowed with an "élan vital", a vital force, came to be viewed as superfluous and discredited, as biological processes revealed themselves to be chemical and molecular. The 19th century also the development of electromagnetism (Faraday and Maxwell), 
        accounting for the properties of charges by positing further extended fields rather than solely appealing to direct influences among particles. Finally, in the 20th century, the physics of Newton was dramatically overturned by the development of 
        relativity and quantum mechanics. The toppling of such a previously long successful theory, and the conceptually strange character of the usurping theories have profoundly shaped the philosophy of science.</p>
        <li>My comments</li>
        <p>As promised, the book strays almost entirely clear of mathematical topics and the advantages that quantitative models and theories can provide over qualitative ones. An exception are 
          parts of chapter 12 on the topic of beliefs and Bayesianism, but even there, we have mainly a light mathematical analysis <em>of</em> scientific thinking rather than a treatment of mathematical analysis <em>in</em> scientific thinking. 
          I found this to be a thing good though, as someone living in the age of machine learning and intelligence, its nice, for a change, to read something that does not facilely extol data and statistics over all else. <br>
          An overall issue I felt reading this book is that though there is a good deal of discussion on how observations and data can fail to support a proposition or theory, there isn't as much of a discussion of how data can succeed as evidence,
          aside from some of the content in chapter 12 (primarily on Bayesianism). For anyone familiar with that kind of probabilistic thinking, the book may do little to deepen their appreciation of the positive relationship that there can be between observations and beliefs in science.
